## üïπ Projects

### PixPhys
**PixPhys** is a sandbox game blending physics simulation with creative engineering. In this debut project, players design a variety of machines, from simple carts with jet engines to complex spacecraft with autonomous flight modes.

### Key Features & Responsibilities:
- **Physics Simulation**: Integrated realistic physics using Unity's built-in engine, including aerodynamics, buoyancy, gravitational changes, and more.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Developed a visual programming system for designing mechanical systems, using over 100 unique parts like propellers, engines, and fuel components.
- **Visual Programming System**: Created a node-based programming interface allowing players to control their creations through intuitive, visual scripting rather than traditional code.
- **Simulated Systems**: Added systems for electricity, fuel, and mechanical transmission to add depth to gameplay, where players must solve problems related to fuel transport and power generation.
- **Modding Support**: Enabled modding capabilities using C#, providing players with tools to create and share custom content. Integrated support for expanding or customizing the game's features via mods.
